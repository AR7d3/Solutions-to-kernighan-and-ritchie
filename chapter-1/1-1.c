#include <stdio.h> // tells the compiler to information about the standard input/output library

int main(){ // main function is required in all C programs that execute. This is where the Program begins executing.
    printf("Hello World!\n"); // calls the library function printf to print the sequence of characters
    return 0; // exits the main function and hence the program execution, indicates that the program ran successfully (or at least without any errors)
